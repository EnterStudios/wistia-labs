# Wistia Labs

Welcome to Wistia Labs! In each folder, you'll find a script that
implements a plugin for the Wistia Player API. There may also be 
an HTML file which, when loaded in the browser, helps you set up 
that plugin with an embed code.

For more information about plugins, you might want to [check out 
the Plugin API docs](http://wistia.com/doc/plugin-api).
