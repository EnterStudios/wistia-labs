# Wistia Labs

Welcome to Wistia Labs!

A Lab takes an embed code and modifies it to do something cool. 
To get started, copy the `template` folder to a new name. Then 
you can modify the files for your lab.

- index.html: The HTML for your lab file.
- style.css: Custom styles for this particular lab page.
- ui.js: Javascript for this particular lab page.
- plugin.js: A skeleton of a Wistia plugin. Rename at will please.

For more information about plugins, you might want to [check out 
the Plugin API docs](http://wistia.com/doc/plugin-api) and 
[the Embed Shepherd docs](http://wistia.com/doc/embed-shepherd).
